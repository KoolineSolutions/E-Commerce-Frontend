# ⚡ Ecommerce Frontend App (Tech: Vite + React) (with Optional Backend Integration)

Welcome to this fast, modern frontend app powered by **React + Vite**!  
You’re about to explore a sleek, optimized project that’s ready for anything — even backend integration.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

This is a lightweight frontend built with **Vite** (for blazing-fast dev experience) and **React** (for dynamic UI).

> Designed to be used **standalone or with a backend** (like Node.js/Express) running on `http://localhost:4000`.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default, the app runs at:  
[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## 🌐 Backend Integration (Optional)

This app is already configured to talk to a backend server using proxy settings in Vite.

### ✅ Proxy Config in `vite.config.js`:

```js
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      target: 'http://localhost:4000',
      rewrite: (path) => path.startsWith('/api') ? path : `/api${path}`,
    },
    '/auth': {
      target: 'http://localhost:4000',
      rewrite: (path) => path.startsWith('/auth') ? path : `/auth${path}`,
    },
  },
}
```

### 🔍 Why It’s Useful

This setup:
- Prevents CORS issues during development.
- Allows API routes like `/api` or `/auth` to be seamlessly forwarded to your backend.
- Keeps your frontend and backend in sync while developing locally.

---

## ⚠️ Don't Have a Backend Yet?

That’s totally fine!

You can:
- Run this project as a **pure frontend**.
- Connect it to your backend **later without breaking anything**.
- Update the proxy only if your backend URL or routes differ.
