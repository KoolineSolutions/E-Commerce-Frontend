# âš¡ Ecommerce Frontend App (Tech: Vite + React)
(with Optional Backend Integration)

Welcome to this modern and fast frontend app built with **React** and **Vite**.

This is a user interface for a complete application. If you're looking to explore or extend it, you're in the right place.

## ðŸš€ Get Started

### 1. Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KoolineSolutions/E-Commerce-Frontend.git
cd <project-folder>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will start on:

## ðŸ”„ Backend Setup (Optional but Recommended)

This project is ready to connect to a backend.

If you want the **full experience** (like data fetching, login, orders, etc.), youâ€™ll need to run the backend too.

> The backend is available in the free resources section. Download and run it alongside this project.

Once the backend is up and running (usually on `http://localhost:4000`), everything will work seamlessly.

---

## ðŸ§© How It Works

- API routes like `/api` and `/auth` are automatically forwarded to the backend using proxy settings.
- No changes are needed unless your backend runs on a different port.
